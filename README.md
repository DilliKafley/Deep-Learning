Trained a model using pytorch to classify the images. Training set has over 60,000 images and testing set has over 10,000 images.Because of the memorr constrain trained the model using only one epoch. acheived the accuracy of over 86%.Performance can be improved if we can train the model on more epochs. Transformations were also not applied so it  can be seen we can improve the performace if me adopt more machinelearning technique.
